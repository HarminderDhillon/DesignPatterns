# DesignPatterns

The code from the Head First Design Patterns book is segregated into packages as per the class diagrams they defined(for a better understanding of the abstractions of these design patterns).
This package structure is meant to be programming language agnostic, so any programming language developer can get an idea of these design patterns from just the package structure.
